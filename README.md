# FinalYearProject-OTP-Chat-application

Chat app utilizing one-time-pad encryption, this form of encryption is mathematically unbreakable
And can only be cracked if the pad itself is discovered or the pad rules are broken.

OTPs we're once used by Soviet Union spies to send messages. This was done by hand so whilst being unbreakable
This method was very slow and severly limited by the maximum length of message.

This application intends to make the utilization of this old and slow manual encryption technique seemless with the use
Of modern computing power.
